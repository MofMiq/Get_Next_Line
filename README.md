# Get_Next_Line
> This repository contains a "Get_Next_Line" project that is part of the Ã‰cole 42 curriculum.

This project is about reading a file descriptor and return it line by line

You will understand how files are opened, read and closed in an OS,
and how they are interpreted by a programming language for further analysis.
This task is crucial to understand for a future programmer since much of the time is based
on manipulating files for data management and persistence.
This project consists of coding a function that returns one line at a time from a text file.
